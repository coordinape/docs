# Buying and Selling Links

Buying and Selling links is done by interacting with the CoLinks smart contract, deployed on OP Mainnet. Buys and Sells are priced on a bonding curve. As more Links are bought, the price will become higher. As they are sold, the price will become lower.&#x20;

Funds from purchased Links are escrowed in the CoLinks smart contract when bought (according to the Buy price), and these funds are redeemed from the contract on selling (according to the Sell price). Each buy and sell also includes fees to CoLinks and the Link issuer. See [CoLinks Smart Contract ](colinks-smart-contract.md)for more details.

### **To Buy a Link:**

* Make sure you have some OP Ethereum in your wallet, enough for payment and gas.
* Browse to the Link you want to own, and buy it via the user’s Profile Page or in the Explore page directly.
* Confirm the transaction in your browser or phone based wallet, or with MagicLink custodial wallet if you have used that method to authenticate.

### **To Sell a Link**

* Be sure you have some OP Ethereum in your wallet, for gas.
* Browse to the link you want to sell, and sell it via the user’s Profile Page.
* Confirm the transaction in your wallet, or with MagicLink custodial wallet if you have used that method to authenticate.
* Please note, you will not see the OP Eth you will receive in the wallet transaction, which only posts the cost of the TX. You can confirm this on Etherscan after the TX has completed.
