# GIVE

## What is GIVE?

* A simple and powerful way to recognize people and impact, inside and outside of the Coordinape platform.
* All ways and forms of giving GIVE are stored onchain as markers in time that someone was recognized for something great. GIVE is stored as pGIVE on the [Coordinape member’s CoSoul.](http://coordinape.com/cosoul)
* You can give GIVE to anyone on Farcaster or [CoLinks](https://colinks.coordinape.com) to recognize them.
* You can [allocate GIVE in Coordinape Gift Circles](https://docs.coordinape.com/get-started/get-started) to recognize and reward value contributed by circle members.

1. Cast "give.party/ `{a-skill-you-want-to-celebrate}`" to start a Give Party\
   (Where you replace `{a-skill-you-want-to-celebrate}`  with your chosen skill to celebrate.)\
   \
   \*\*\***NOTE: Due to Warpcast's  assertive prefetching, this works best if you paste the URL for your party into your cast.** [**You can also go straight to give.party in your browser and use our PARTY STARTER!**](https://give.party)\

2. Anyone on Farcaster can use the frame that shows up to name people who they think are awesome at that skill.

3. Givebot will make sure your GIVE is delivered!\

## GIVE in CoLinks, Farcaster, and Warpcast

Your GIVE balance increases by 1 per day, and in the future will be increased at a higher rate for those with higher Rep. GIVE balance is viewable in CoLinks in the top right corner of your CoLinks Home page.

## **Giving GIVE in Farcaster and Warpcast**

You can give in Warpcast by mentioning the `@givebot` , and it will deliver the GIVE to the recipient for you.

### **As a Reply Cast:**

`@givebot` as a reply cast to another cast, and Givebot will deliver a GIVE to the original caster from you.

### **As a new Cast:**

Givebot responds to format `@givebot @user #skilltag`

When giving from a new cast, you need to @mention another user as the recipient.

The `#skilltag` is an optional way to add more context to the GIVE so others know more about why you want to recognize someone, adding to their onchain reputation history.

You should see the Givebot respond with a message that the GIVE was delivered and a Frame that welcomes you into the GIVE app.
