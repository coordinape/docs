# Welcome to Coordinape

Coordinape is a platform for DAOs to easily and fairly distribute resources to contributors. Community grants, internal salaries, and special projects can all be incentivized and rewarded by the community itself. Instead of cumbersome voting or black box committees, contributors themselves can quickly and transparently reward the value they see being created.

## Vision

The promise of DAOs is decentralized collaboration, where teams of people can solve hard problems together and share in the rewards of the work. As the revolutionary potential of DAOs becomes increasingly apparent, so do their challenges and limitations... especially by those operating within them. Coordinape aims to make the actual experience of people working in DAOS more dynamic, rewarding and fair.

Coordinape moves more decision making to the community. The simple premise is that if you ask everyone in the community who is doing good work, their collective answers will give a good sense of where the value is and who should be most rewarded. Over time, this also provides valuable insights for the DAO about what kinds of work is prioritized, what the community finds most valuable, and who are the key contributors in different areas. The shared visual display also enables everyone in the community to see who is working on what and find opportunities for collaboration or reduce duplication of effort.

The focus now is on gift circles for resource distribution, but features are being added continually so that budgeting, recruiting and onboarding, project prioritization, and investments can all be done on the platform.

## How It Works

Coordinape is currently implemented as an off-chain alpha while we continue to develop our on-chain version, using an EVM compatible L2 or side-chain.

Coordinape is built around Circles - groups of DAO participants that wish to distribute funds through a decentralized gifting process. Each Circle can define the rules of participation -- it can grow its network permissionlessly, set parameters around certain elements of its game mechanics and toggle network visibility, either through centralized admin or internal governance.

Circles run in Epochs: periods of time in which its constituent body of contributors can send each other GIVE tokens, which represent that Circle's total budget allocation. We envision Epochs as monthly events, where contributors can consider each other's collaboration, mutual enablement and furthering of the DAO's mission over that time period. Each member is allocated a fixed amount of GIVE (100 by default), and can send any number of these tokens to other Circle members freely during the Epoch. Members can also opt out if they receive funding elsewhere, allowing them to send GIVE but not receive it. GIVE has no value if it is not given to another Circle member -- the process of gifting defines the per-member payout from the circle's budget.

When the Epoch ends, the GIVE each member has received can be exchanged for a pro rata amount of monthly treasury budget.

## Learn More

Coordinape is currently in an off-chain alpha phase, working with select teams like Yearn to develop and refine the experience. There is a public version available, and accessible through www.coordinape.com.
