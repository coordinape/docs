# âšª Welcome to Coordinape

With Coordinape, communities can manage grants, salaries, and projects so that everyone involved can participate in rewarding and incentivizing each contribution.

Contributors transparently reward the value they see created in an organization. The reward-giving process is lean and allows anyone to quickly weight-in. No more cumbersome voting or black-box committees!
