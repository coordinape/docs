# Contribute to Coordinape

Coordinape is open source. Want to help build Coordinape? Welcome! You are in the right place. This guide serves as the first entry point in helping a new developer get the Coordinape app running and writing code. Have questions? Is the guide out of date? Submit a PR and help the next contributor.

## Code Repositories

Our [code is hosted on Github](http://github.com/coordinape/) in three separate repositories.

- [Frontend repo](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape)
- [Backend repo](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape-backend)
- [Solidity / Protocols repo](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape-protocol)

Each repository above includes a README.md in the root of the repo with instructions on getting that app running. Our current Coordinape app runs off-chain using the Frontend and Backend repos. Our solidity repo is under active development as we move Coordinape on-chain.

## Getting Started

To get your development environment started begin with following the [README](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape-backend/blob/main/README.md) in the Backend repo. Once the backend is up and running next follow the [README](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape/blob/master/README.md) the Frontend repo.
