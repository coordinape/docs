# Coordinape Community

Coordinape's goal is to become a DAO lego. We want to be a platform that DAOs can build on and with to accomplish their goals. Suppose you want to check out the community. In that case, the primary place is in our [discord.](https://discord.coordinape.com) We do office hours on Mondays and Thursdays to help answer any Coordinape or DAO questions you may have and a Community call every other Wednesday. \
\
We'd love to chat on any of those calls!&#x20;
