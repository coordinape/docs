# üîÆ Social Oracle‚Ñ¢Ô∏è GIVE

## Find Social Oracle on EAS

[https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0x82c2ec8ec89cf1d13022ff0867744f1cecf932faa4fe334aa1bb443edbfee3fa](https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0x82c2ec8ec89cf1d13022ff0867744f1cecf932faa4fe334aa1bb443edbfee3fa)

## What is the Social Oracle?

Coordinape's recognition and reputation primitive [GIVE ](colinks/give.md)is ONCHAIN! \
GIVE is a Permissionless Public Good reputation primitive that creates a valuable and trusted Social Oracle of connections and attestations from peer to peer about skills and experiences.

\
GIVEs created in [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/), [CoLinks](https://colinks.coordinape.com/info), and [GIVE.party](https://colinks.coordinape.com/giveparty) now get written to [Base Chain](https://base.org) via attestations created with[ Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/).  We've built GIVE as a reputation primitive and brought it onchain to make it universally accessible and integratable. &#x20;

## How can I use it?

### Integrate the Social Oracle

Coordinape creates attestations on behalf of authenticated users when they create and give GIVEs to other users. Therefore GIVEs "From" `onchain.coordinape.eth` are highly trustworthy. \
\
You can query any EAS Schema using the EAS GraphQL API. [Learn more here.](https://docs.attest.org/docs/developer-tools/api)

#### **Some of the possible ways to integrate the Social Oracle**

* **Resume or CV** - GIVE can act as an endorsement that a given person has a skill. The more GIVE about the skill, the more trusted the person is likely to be about that skill.&#x20;
* **Social and professional Discovery** - The network of GIVEs reveals much rich data about people and relationships. It's extremely easy to get leads for people who have specific skills or qualities using the Social Oracle.
* **Gating/Eligibility/qualification -** Since GIVE is on [BASE](https://base.org) , it's easily possible to gate web3 organizations, events, groups, and more by simply requiring that participants have enough onchain GIVE or GIVE from a particular source or GIVE of a particular skill. There a many possibilities!
* **Humanity Scoring** - Given the social oracle data, it's easy to create or add to formulas that can add to or even guarantee the likelihood that a user is actually a human.&#x20;

### Issue GIVE attestations

Anyone can openly use the [GIVE Schema](https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0x82c2ec8ec89cf1d13022ff0867744f1cecf932faa4fe334aa1bb443edbfee3fa) to create GIVE attestations.&#x20;

Use the [GIVE Schema](https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0x82c2ec8ec89cf1d13022ff0867744f1cecf932faa4fe334aa1bb443edbfee3fa) to issue GIVE attestations from your trusted organization to add more trusted data to the Social Oracle.\
_\*If your org/project plans to do this, feel free to reach out to us in our_ [_Discord_](https://discord.gg/GFASZtq6Sw) _and we may be interested to integrate your GIVE data into our use of the Social Oracle._ \
