# Discord Bot

Coordinape was built initially for Yearn Finance, a DAO that heavily uses Telegram. Hence, our bot features have (until now) been centered around that platform. Now, we've begun to port our bot to Discord, and added easy webhook integration functions to the Coordinape admin panel. Read on for an overview and how to set it up. More features will be added to the bot over time.

### What can the Discord Bot do?

* Caesar can let your discord know when a users has opted out of a current epoch, and how much give was refunded. ![](<images/Bot Opted Out.jpg>)
* Inform users that an epoch is active ![](<images/Bot Comment.jpg>)
* Let users know when the epoch ends

#### BOOM! You now have Caesar helping you keep track of active Epochs, giving you a heads up when users make allocations, and letting you know if a user opts out. We'll be adding features to the bot over time, but in the meantime we hope you enjoy this functionality!

If you appreciate this make sure to let Zashton know!
