# Creating A Circle

## What's A Circle?

A Circle is equal to a team. Teams of people will allow you to compensate members within your organization.

### Circle Size

Circles can have 1-200+ members in them. We recommend Circles of at least **three members.** The closer the team members are, the more accurate the compensation process is.

## Setting up your Circle

You can create a Circle from the Coordinape homepage.

Clicking on the **Get Started** button will take you to the app, where you can log in and create your Circle.

You can also create a new Circle from the Org Overview page by clicking the **Create Org** button or from the Org page by clicking the **Add Circle** button

**Organization:** This is the higher level of your Circle that will encompass all of the Circles within an organization.

The Organization name will need to be verified by the Coordinape Team to prevent spoofing from another Team.
