# Add Team Members

Once you've started your Circle, two members will be You and Coordinape.&#x20;

### Coordinape in Your Circle

> At Coordinape we believe that we are building something that will help propel our industry forward in the way we think about compensation.
>
> In an effort to ensure as many DAOs as possible have access to Coordinape we have decided to forgo charging a fee to use Coordinape.
>
> We've opted instead to rely on the gifts of the DAO's we provide value to.
>
> The address associated with the Coordinape user is our donation address we can accept donations on EVM compatible chains.
