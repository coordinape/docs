# Get Paid

Every circle may perform the distributions differently. \
Some circles may distribute on the mainnet, use L2s on a non-ETH L1, and use Coordinape ahead of a token and will just be tracking the allocations until there is a token to distribute.

### Circle Admin

Your circle admin will be able to tell you how the distributions will happen.

Until then, sit back and wait for your rewards to show up in your funds!
