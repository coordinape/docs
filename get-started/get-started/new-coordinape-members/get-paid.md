# Get Paid

### Every[ Circle](../../circles/) may perform the distributions differently.

Some Circles may distribute on the mainnet, use L2s on a non-ETH L1, and use Coordinape ahead of a token and will just be tracking the allocations until there is a token to distribute.

For more information, see [paying-your-team](../../compensation/paying-your-team/ "mention")

![S/O to Zerion for the awesome transaction history!](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

### Circle Admin

Your Circle admin can tell you how and when the distributions will happen.
