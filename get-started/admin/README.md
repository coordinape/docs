# 🎩 Admin

## **Permissions**&#x20;

**As an admin, you can control the following:**

* Circle Creation
* Circle Settings
* Epoch Settings
* Manage Members&#x20;
* Vouching Requirements&#x20;
* Export Allocation Data

## Best Practices

The best practices for running Coordinape will vary from team to team. But, in general, we find that teams that **communicate** their goals for Coordinape to their contributors will have a better experience than teams that start circles without communicating with their users.&#x20;

So, when communicating to your teams, here are some things to make sure to mention:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="GIVE Eligibility  " %}
* Who should be eligible to send and receive give?
* Should members compensated via grants or salaries be rewarded?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Work Dates " %}
* Which dates should your contributors be thinking about when allocating?
* Should users consider all of the prior months when allocating?&#x20;
* Should they only consider work that members completed?&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Contribution Impact" %}
* What type of activity would you like your contributors to be rewarding?
* Should a particular type of work be more valuable? (Devs or Business Development?)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Compensation Method" %}
* How with the allocations be paid out?
* Will they be paid in stable coins or project tokens, or is your DAO just tracking contributions until they have a token to distribute**?**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Team Size**&#x20;

Team sizes can range from 2-200+, but it's easier to allocate to smaller teams (<20), so the users can interact with most team members.

****

**Compensation Amounts**

The amount of compensation for each epoch can vary. It can be zero; it can be infinity.

Before our on-chain launch, there is no escrow feature, so the admin will distribute the compensation after the epoch ends.

Once on-chain, funds for epochs will be escrowed in the Ape Vaults and automatically made available to claim or distribute at the end of the epoch after the admin approves the distributions.

**Use Cases We've Seen**

* Giving to Contributors
* Giving to Projects
* Giving to other circles
