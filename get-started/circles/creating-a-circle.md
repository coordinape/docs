# Creating a Circle

## Setting up your Circle

You can create a circle from the Coordinape homepage or by going to [https://app.coordinape.com/new-circle](https://app.coordinape.com/new-circle).

Clicking on the **Start a Circle** button will take you to the screen where you can create your Circle.
