## Discord Bot

{% hint style="info" %}
The Bot is currently in beta testing. Please provide any feedback you may have in the Coordinape Discord by going to the **Roles** channel and reacting to the Discord Bot Tester message to get permission to join the Discord Bot Channel.

{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}

{% endhint %}

1. Click the Dropdown

The Bot will create a Channel, and a Role for each Circle in your Discord and then send this message:&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Enable Alerts" %}

It's as simple as typing `/Coordinape Contribute` in Discord and then entering the contribution you made.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After you hit Enter you'll be prompted to save your submission. After clicking save the Bot will submit your contribution to the app for your team to see, and will publicly post your contribution in the channel.&#x20;
