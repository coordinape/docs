# CO Token Utility

The Coordinape app now emits the ability to attest with [GIVE](../social-oracle-tm-give.md) at higher rates for wallet addresses that hold the [CO token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf828BA501B108FbC6c88eBDfF81C401BB6B94848).  Coordinape has created a utility for the CO token to encourage and empower individuals to contribute to and grow the social reputation footprint of the [Social Oracle](../social-oracle-tm-give.md). \
\
Now, if your logged in wallet also holds the CO token, your GIVE bank cap will be increased and so will your emission of GIVE itself.  The chart below shows the GIVE emission rates for each CO holding level:

| Amount of CO | GIVE emissions Rate | GIVE Cap |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------- |
| < 1K         | 1 per day           | 20       |
| 1K - 10K     | 4 per day           | 20       |
| 10K - 33 K   | 10 per day          | 30       |
| 33K - 100K   | 20 per day          | 69       |
| 100K +       | 100 per day         | 200      |

The CO token is governed by the CoDAO. You can learn more about the CoDAO and get involved by checking out the [CoDAO Charmverse site](https://app.charmverse.io/codao/1-codao-mission-20572971131480156).&#x20;
