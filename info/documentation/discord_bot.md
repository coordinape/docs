# Discord Bot

Coordinape was built initially for Yearn Finance, a DAO that heavily uses Telegram. Hence, our bot features have been centered around that platform. Now, we've begun to port our bot to Discord, and added easy webhook integration functions to the Coordinape admin panel. Read on for an overview and how to set it up. More features will be added to the bot over time.

### What can the Discord Bot do?

* Caesar can let your discord know when a users has opted out of a current epoch, and how much give was refunded.
