## Permissionless Circles are here!

For the last few months we have been diligently working towards full permissionlessness (it's a word, don't spellcheck it), and on chain implementation.

As one more step torwards permissionlessness we are happy to release Permissionless Circles! 

Now **anyone** can spin up a new circle by going to https://coordinape.com and connecting their wallet.

If you're not already in a circle you will be prompted to create a new circle. <img src="/images/Welcome.png">

_If you were expecting to be in a circle and aren't please contact your circle admin so they can get your address fixed_

If you're already in a circle you can create a new circle by navigating to https://app.coordinape.com/new-circle 

If you're an admin of a circle you can click the create

Clicking on the **Start a Circle** button will take you to the screen where you can create your circle.

The fields on this screen will be the fields used when you start your circle they can be changed once the circle is created, but only by the circle admin. 

* **Username:** This will be how other users will see your name in the circle. (If your already in other circles please use the exact same name used in the other circles.) 

* **ETH address:** This is derived from the wallet you're currently connected to Coordinape with

* **Circle Name:** This will be the name of the Circle that your users will select. 

  _(EG Coordinape has a Contributors circle)_ 

* **Organization name:** This is the higher level to your circle that will eventually encompass all of the circles within an organization. 

  _(EG Yearn has Strategists, Community, and  003 Circles, and Bankless has a circle for their guilds, KrauseHouse has circles for their projects)_
  
  The name you put here will need to be verified by the Coordinape Team to prevent spoofing another Team.

The rest of the fields are informational, and help us know how your using Coordinape so we have a better idea of how we can serve you. 

In the **How can we contact you** field, if your leaving your discord handle please use this format _name#1234_ so we can make sure to connect to the correct person. 

After you click **Launch Circle** you're in!
